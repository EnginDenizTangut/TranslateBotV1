# Seq2Seq Machine Translation Model

This project demonstrates a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model built for machine translation, specifically translating English sentences to Spanish. The model is implemented using Keras, leveraging an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture for both the encoder and decoder components.

## Introduction

This project aims to build a seq2seq model to translate sentences from English to Spanish. The model utilizes Keras with LSTM layers to create both the encoder and decoder for sequence translation. Additionally, the model is integrated with MLflow for tracking and managing experiments.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow mlflow
